title: HTTPS listeners

Create an HTTPS listener on your API gateway. Then, your API gateway listens for secured HTTPS traffic on the specified port and hostname that you configure.

## Create a TLS certificate

## Set up an HTTPS listener

1. Create a gateway resource and configure an HTTPS listener. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: https
     namespace: kgateway-system
     labels:
       gateway: https
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: kgateway
     listeners:
       - name: https
         port: 443
         protocol: HTTPS
         hostname: https.example.com
         tls:
           mode: Terminate
           certificateRefs:
             - name: https
               kind: Secret
         allowedRoutes:
           namespaces:
             from: All
   EOF
   ```

   |Setting|Description|
   |--|--|
   |`spec.gatewayClassName`|The name of the Kubernetes gateway class that you want to use to configure the gateway. When you set up kgateway, a default gateway class is set up for you. |
   |`spec.listeners`|Configure the listeners for this gateway. In this example, you configure an HTTPS gateway that listens for incoming traffic on port 443. |
   |`spec.listeners.tls.mode`|The TLS mode that you want to use for incoming requests. In this example, HTTPS requests are terminated at the gateway and the unecrypted request is forwarded to the service in the cluster. |
   |`spec.listeners.tls.certificateRefs`|The Kubernetes secret that holds the TLS certificate and key for the gateway. The gateway uses these credentials to establish the TLS connection with a client, and to decrypt incoming HTTPS requests.|

2. Verify that the status of the gateway shows `ACCEPTED`. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get gateway/https -n kgateway-system -o yaml
   ```

3. Create an HTTP route for the httpbin app and add it to the HTTPS gateway that you created. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-https
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-route
       gateway: https
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: https
         namespace: kgateway-system
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

4. Verify that the HTTP route is applied successfully. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get httproute/httpbin-https -n httpbin -o yaml
   ```

5. Get the external address of the gateway and save it in an environment variable. Note that it might take a few seconds for the gateway address to become available.

   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n kgateway-system https -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
   echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS   
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc/https -n kgateway-system 8443:443
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

6. Send a request to the httpbin app and verify that you see the TLS handshake and you get back a 200 HTTP response code. 
   {{< tabs items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik --resolve "https.example.com:443:${INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS}" https://https.example.com:443/status/200
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik --connect-to https.example.com:443:localhost:8443 https://https.example.com:443/status/200
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: 
   ```

   ```

## Cleanup

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cleanup.md" >}}

1. Remove the HTTP route for the httpbin app, the HTTPS gateway, and the Kubernetes secret that holds the TLS certificate and key.
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute,gateway,secret -A -l gateway=https
   ```

2. Remove the `example_certs` directory that stores your TLS credentials. 
   ```sh
   rm -rf example_certs
   ```
